# üåê Modern Encryption Tool

Welcome to the **Modern Encryption Tool**! This web-based application allows you to encrypt and decrypt text using **AES-256 encryption** and **Base64 encoding** through a beautiful, modern, and intuitive interface. The encryption process is done in three layers: first AES-256 encryption, followed by Base64 encoding, and finally, a second AES-256 encryption. Similarly, the decryption follows the reverse process.

## üåü Features

- **Triple-layer encryption**: AES-256 ‚û°Ô∏è Base64 ‚û°Ô∏è AES-256.
- **Modern User Interface**: Clean, minimalist, and fully responsive UI with smooth transitions and engaging interactions.
- **Easy to use**: Simple inputs for encryption and decryption with clear prompts.
- **Instant Feedback**: Encrypted and decrypted results are shown instantly on the same page.
- **Cross-browser support**: Works seamlessly across modern browsers.
- **Customizable**: Easy to modify and expand with additional features.
  
## üé® User Interface

The UI includes:
1. **Encryption Tab**: Input your plain text and two AES-256 keys. The encrypted result will appear in the output field.
2. **Decryption Tab**: Input your previously encrypted text and the same AES-256 keys used for encryption. The original text will be displayed as output.

The interface features:
- **Beautiful Icons**: Leveraging Font Awesome for lock/unlock icons to make it visually appealing.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Button and input effects are visually smooth and responsive, creating a modern feel.
- **Interactive Tab Navigation**: Switch between encryption and decryption tabs with a single click.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project locally, all you need is a web browser. No additional setup is required.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/encryption-tool.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd encryption-tool
    ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in any web browser:
    ```bash
    open index.html
    ```

That's it! You now have the encryption tool running locally.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

The encryption and decryption processes are done using **CryptoJS**, a powerful JavaScript library for cryptographic algorithms.

### Encryption Process
1. **AES-256 encryption**: The text is first encrypted with the first AES-256 key.
2. **Base64 encoding**: The AES-encrypted text is then Base64-encoded for safe storage or transmission.
3. **Second AES-256 encryption**: Finally, the Base64-encoded text is encrypted again using the second AES-256 key.

### Decryption Process
1. **First AES-256 decryption**: The encrypted text is decrypted with the second AES-256 key.
2. **Base64 decoding**: The resulting text is decoded from Base64 format.
3. **Second AES-256 decryption**: Finally, the Base64-decoded text is decrypted again using the first AES-256 key.

### Key Points
- **AES-256 Encryption**: Advanced Encryption Standard with a 256-bit key is used for strong encryption.
- **Base64 Encoding**: Ensures the encrypted data can be safely transmitted or stored as text.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the structure and layout of the application.
- **CSS3**: For modern, responsive design, including smooth transitions and effects.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For encryption and decryption logic.
- **CryptoJS**: For AES-256 encryption and Base64 encoding/decoding.
- **Font Awesome**: For icons used in buttons and interface elements.

## üéØ To-Do List

- [ ] Add the ability to save encrypted files.
- [ ] Implement more encryption algorithms (RSA, Blowfish, etc.).
- [ ] Add a password strength meter.
- [ ] Implement a dark mode theme.
- [ ] Add multi-language support.

## üßë‚Äçüè´ Usage Instructions

### Encrypting Text
1. Go to the "Encrypt" tab.
2. Enter the text you want to encrypt in the "Text to Encrypt" field.
3. Enter the first AES key (256-bit) in the first key input field.
4. Enter the second AES key (256-bit) in the second key input field.
5. Click the "Encrypt" button.
6. The encrypted text will appear in the output field.

### Decrypting Text
1. Go to the "Decrypt" tab.
2. Enter the encrypted text in the "Text to Decrypt" field.
3. Enter the first AES key (256-bit) in the first key input field (same key used during encryption).
4. Enter the second AES key (256-bit) in the second key input field (same key used during encryption).
5. Click the "Decrypt" button.
6. The decrypted text will appear in the output field.

## üîß Configuration

The tool is ready to use out of the box, but you can modify the following parts:
- **AES keys**: You can easily modify how keys are handled, e.g., by implementing a key generation function.
- **User Interface**: All UI elements are modular and can be customized in `style.css`.
- **Additional Security**: You can add more encryption layers or switch to other algorithms by updating the JavaScript logic.

- [Base64 Encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64)
  
## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

When using this tool:
- **AES-256 is secure**: AES-256 is one of the most secure encryption algorithms, used by governments and organizations worldwide.
- **Key Security**: Ensure that the AES keys are securely stored and transmitted. The strength of AES encryption lies in the confidentiality of the key.
